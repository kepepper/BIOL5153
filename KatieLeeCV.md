### Currently

I am currently in my third year of work toward my PhD in the [CEMB](cell.uark.edu) program at the University of Arkansas. My focus is on the genetic basis of ascites in poultry species, with a specific focus on the implementation of breeding programs to reduce disease incidence.

### Project Involvement

#### Validation of a SNP panel for breeding against ascites in broilers.  
NIFA-AFRI; 3/2018-2/2021; $500,000; PI: Rhoads

For this project I participated in genotyping, selecting, and breeding the ascites-resistant line, as well as organizing, maintaining, and analyzing the broiler trials meant to assess the impact on ascites phenotype and production traits.

#### High Resolution Mapping of Genetic Determinants for Resistance to Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Broilers.  
Arkansas Biosciences Institute; 7/2020-6/2021; $74,521; PI: Rhoads; coPIs: Toro, Alrubaye, Dridi, Pummill

For this project I participated as a research assistant with the blood and tissue sampling of birds.

### Involvement

* Selected for Graduate Dean's Student Advisory Committee as an Interdisciplinary Studies Representative

* Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Student Association treasurer
